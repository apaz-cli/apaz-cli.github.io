For the longest time I've felt like the mainstream media was biased and out of touch. If 
you asked most people, they would probably agree with that. But a few months ago I had a 
few interactions with mainstream journalists at tech meetups. Specifically, I was 
interviewed by Forbes. And by a few other outlets since then.

I have three gripes. They


## Gripe #1: Zombie Journalists

I'll describe the first time I met a journalist, at a company happy hour.

The interaction felt empty in a way that I found difficult to put my finger on. They 
asked me for details on the projects I was working on, how they were important, and why. 
At first, I felt seen in an incredible way. Journalists have a way of making you feel 
like that.

But I also felt in the back of my mind that although the journalist I was speaking to 
was very professional, and she was very good at asking questions, she truly was not 
interested in the technology that she was writing about. It's fine not to understand, 
most people do not know or care about deep learning compilers, but I felt that she did 
not care to understand either. She did not ask clarifying questions, even I prompted her 
to.

She just wrote down what I said, and tried to make me feel special. It was a bit 
unsettling. Every journalist I've spoken to since then has made me feel this way.

When the article came out the next morning, I was astonished to find that her name was 
not even on the article. Instead, it was some random dude that I never met. Even though 
she did all the information gathering for it. She did all the research! She should get 
credit! What the heck!

Every time I've spoken with a journalist since, I've felt the same professional 
emptiness and disinterest. I guess now I know why she felt that way. Knowing you're not 
going to get any credit for your reporting has got to suck major ass.

Anyway, [here's the article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2024/03/28/lightning-studio-an-ios-for-ai-development/) 
this story is based on.


## Gripe #2: Zombie Reporting

I feel like, even as they report on current events, major media outlets are hopelessly trapped in the past.

Mainstream media is beholden to the whim of capital. Pay them, and they'll write a story on you. Everybody knows that. That's old news. Give me something more interesting.

I wish I never thought that. Because just as I thought that, [this dropped](https://time.com/collection/time100-ai-2024/).

<>This makes me want to scream and vomit simultaneously.<>

Time released their list of 100

Where is Tri Dao? Where is Woosuk Kwon? Where is Zhuohan Li? Was whoever made this list 
on fucking crack?

Reviled 

What bothers me more is that irks me more than that is that

 know that. It used to be that 



## Gripe #3: If it isn't capital intensive it doesn't exist.
