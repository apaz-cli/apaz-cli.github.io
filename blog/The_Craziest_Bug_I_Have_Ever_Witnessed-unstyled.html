<h1 id="the-craziest-bug-i-have-ever-witnessed">The Craziest Bug I Have
Ever Witnessed</h1>
<p>    Julia has a feature where you can report bugs and crashes from
the command line. You just run your program with
<code>julia --bug-report=rr</code>, and it sends a crash report plus an
<code>rr</code> trace of the process to our servers for us to take a
look at.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">

This is Keno's meme, and I have unabashedly stolen it.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>    Sometimes we get some crazy stuff. This is in fact not the first
time that someone from the Julia team has found something crazy in a
crash dump. Keno Fischer wrote a similar (and substantially more
detailed) article <a
href="https://julialang.org/blog/2020/09/rr-memory-magic/">here</a>,
where he used <code>rr</code> to debug a process where the issue turned
out to be faulty memory.</p>
<p>    Where Keno visually detailed how he found the bug, I'm just going
to rant from memory. I should have kept better records. Oh well. Live
and learn.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="the-crash">The Crash</h2>
<p>    Julia is a garbage collected language, written mostly written in
itself, but partially in C and C++. The bug manifested as a random crash
in function dispatch inside the interpreter, which is also written in
Julia. The function dispatch code is well tested. When the interpreter
crashes, it's generally the case that there was already memory
corruption.</p>
<p>    We contacted the user, and we asked them for the source code of
the program that produced the crash and all the data they used to run
it. Graciously, they were able to provide it.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/println.jpg" alt="println meme">
<figcaption>
<code>printf()</code> debugging is glorious, in all its forms.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>    Usually, my preferred method of debugging is
<code>printf()</code> debugging. It's great. It's simple. It catches
most things. However, not this time. This crash was random, and hard to
reproduce. I tried to reproduce it, but could never reproduce it
exactly. So, I was forced to take the "midwit" approach and try to
figure it out using <code>rr</code> traces.</p>
<p>    Memory corruption bugs generally suck to find. When you're
writing C, you can usually just compile with
<code>-fsanitize=address</code>. Address Sanitizer will tell you when
you overwrite memory that shouldn't be impossible to assign to within
the usual confines of C or C++. Unfortunately, the Julia runtime doesn't
support being compiled with asan because it depends on third party
binaries that were <em>not</em> compiled with asan. This means that when
our binary reaches into memory allocated for variables in those
libraries, asan will throw a false positive and crash. When one part of
the process is compiled with asan, it all must be.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="finding-the-bug">Finding The Bug</h2>
<p>    Without asan as a crutch, I decided to do as my forebears did and
guessed.</p>
<p>    I loaded up <code>rr</code>, typed <code>bt full</code>, and...
even after a while of gawking at it, this stack trace doesn't make any
sense. The stack trace very clearly doesn't follow the control flow of
the source code. Why? How is that possible?</p>
<p>    Dispatch in Julia is dynamic. From where the crash happened, my
initial guess was that either a C function pointer or Julia object was
written on top of another. But... how? And where?</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/patrick_thinking.png" alt="Patrick thinking meme">
</figure>
<p>    Reading through the backtrace, I found that the process crashed
after a <code>jl_call()</code> to <code>abstract_invoke()</code>. That
rules out that a C function pointer is the culprit. We're looking for a
Julia object written on top of another.</p>
<p>    I was still new to the Julia codebase at this point, so for a day
or two I was stuck. I spent half an hour reading different parts of the
runtime that the process was touching. Nothing seemed to pop out at
me.</p>
<p>    New idea. I try to replicate the bug through brute force. I sshed
4 different servers, downloaded the files, and ran the program 40 times
at once with <code>rr</code>, on each machine. Eventually a few of them
crashed. Some crashed in similar ways, in well tested interpreter code.
Others crashed in different ways. The crash almost always happened in a
different place. Sometimes there was a nonsense backtrace, and sometimes
there wasn't. Sometime it crashed in Julia code, and sometimes in C
code. Often it crashed in external libraries. The bug was rare, I would
get a new trace to look through every 10 minutes or so. So, I'm guessing
one ten million or so.</p>
<p>    Brute forcing it didn't give me the answer, but it did give me
information.</p>
<p>    Eventually, I got an <code>rr</code> trace that seemed useful.
This led me to start reading the Julia garbage collector, and at last
the answer seemed obvious.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/I_do_see_it.jpg" alt="I do see it">
<figcaption>
The face I made when I had the epiphany
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>    When Julia objects are allocated, they are never relocated. They
stay there forever, until they are garbage collected or the process
exits. Therefore, it is actually impossible that an object was written
on top of another... unless it happened in the garbage collector's
allocator.</p>
<pre><code>So, I set a breakpoint on `jl_gc_alloc()` and `jl_gc_sweep()`, and watched the pointers</code></pre>
<p>that came out of the allocator. Sure enough,
<code>jl_gc_alloc()</code> returned the same pointer twice before
<code>jl_gc_sweep()</code>. That is not supposed to happen. The question
remains, why is it happening?</p>
<p>    When I descended deeper, I found that <code>jl_gc_alloc()</code>
just calls <code>malloc()</code>, offsets the resulting pointer, and
does a bunch of bookkeeping to register the new object with the Julia
runtime. So, it was actually <code>malloc()</code> that returned the
same thing twice.</p>
<p>... Excuse me, what? This program is single threaded!</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/biting_keyboard.jpg" alt="Biting Keyboard">
<figcaption>
Deliver me from this hell.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>    I time traveled back and set a breakpoint on <code>free()</code>.
Nope. It isn't freed. Libc just straight up returned the same pointer
twice. What? How does that happen?</p>
<p>    Collecting myself, I noted that there was an extra call to
<code>malloc()</code> between the two calls to
<code>jl_gc_alloc()</code>. What is that?</p>
<p>    When I time traveled to the next call and typed <code>bt</code>
once more into <code>rr</code>, I saw that the call to
<code>malloc()</code> happened on a signal stack, inside a call to
<code>jl_backtrace_from_here()</code>. Suddenly, I knew exactly what the
bug was and where.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>    Most C programmers understand that the linker can do dynamic
linking for you. Fewer understand lazy binding, and fewer have delved
further into the C or ELF standards for the other information.</p>
<p>    It is unsafe to call even AS-Safe functions from a signal
handler, if the libraries they're from have not been loaded yet. If a
library is dynamically loaded inside a signal handler, it may corrupt
the allocator, which may crash the program. Or worse, like in this case,
it might not.</p>
<p>    Signal safety is a difficult topic for people wrap their heads
around. <code>man signal-safety</code> is present, but doesn't do the
topic justice.</p>
<p>    The short version of the signal safety rant is that if a function
is not on the list of allowed functions from
<code>man signal-safety</code>, do not call it from a signal handler.
Even if you did not type the call yourself. If you do call something
that calls something not from that list, then understand it is undefined
behavior and that you are doing so at your own peril. It is also against
the rules to modify any shared global state, or risk the same sort of
corruption.</p>
<p>    This explanation is sufficient to avoid all issues with signal
handlers, but is too restrictive, and so it is ignored. We want to be
able to do interesting things in signal handlers, that's why they're
there. So, in practice, we still have to understand the rules.</p>
<p>    To understand why <code>malloc()</code> is not signal safe, for
simplicity's sake suppose that it's implemented something like this:</p>

<p>    In that circumstance, when the return value is decided and the
thread is paused before the bookkeeping completes, you can see how
<code>malloc()</code> would return the same thing twice. The same thing
happens inside glibc. It grabs a pointer from the freelist, but doesn't
completely erase the record of it in the same instruction. Sometimes the
allocator gets completely corrupted, and sometimes it doesn't. It
depends on the timing of the signal, which is of course impossible to
predict.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-bug-so-hard-to-find">Why is this bug so hard to
find?</h2>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/hunter_or_hunted.jpg" alt="Not sure if I am hunting the bugs, or if the bugs are hunting me">
</figure>
<p>    Four things make this bug particularly insidious.</p>
<p>    First, the bug is not even in the code the programmer wrote. It's
in code that the linker injected, in a completely different section of
the project from where the crash happens.</p>
<p>    Specifically, the crash happened inside of function dispatch
inside of LLVM ORC JIT while compiling code that the runtime had not
seen before. This was a massive red herring. LLVM had nothing to do with
the bug, it was just the first thing that requested memory after the
allocator was corrupted. Function dispatch is massively complicated,
LLVM's JIT compiler is even more complicated, and none of them were the
source of the issue.</p>
<p>    Second, the code looks totally reasonable. People don't know they
are doing something unsafe by calling ostensibly signal-safe code from a
signal handler. The linker inserts a trampoline, and that's what calls
<code>malloc()</code>. Two hidden layers. Even if you know about one of
those, you may not know about the other.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/lgtm.jpg" alt="Looks good to me monkey">
<figcaption>
You can see how this code could get a stamp of approval from a reviewer.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>    Third, Julia is a ridiculously large project. Working on Julia
was the first time that I touched a codebase too large for any one
person to understand, and it changes too fast to keep up with. It's
enormously challenging to maintain a mental model of the entire project,
and even more challenging to know where to look for a bug when you don't
even have a mental model. So we are forced to rely on bug reports and
tools like <code>rr</code> to help us.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/cargo_cult.jpg" alt="Buildkite cargo cult">
<figcaption>
Buildkite and other CI/CD tools are great, but not a substitute for
understanding the code.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>    Fourth, the bug is not reproducible. It only happens when the
backtrace signal handler is called during a call to
<code>malloc()</code>. That can happen basically anywhere. In the
original trace provided in the bug report, <code>malloc()</code> did not
crash immediately, it just returned the same pointer twice. That
allocator's bookkeeping was overwritten, but that wasn't the cause of
the crash either.</p>
<p>    The crash actually happened when the Julia object that was
allocated was used. Since the same pointer was returned twice, there
were two objects that were supposed to be distinct but had the same
address. By coincidence, they were both allocated in the same place, and
so they had the same type but were supposed to hold different data,
which eventually led to the wrong function being called from a different
julia object, a nonsense stack trace, and eventually a crash in function
dispatch.</p>
<p>    I should also note that without making the use of multiple high
end servers with 40 threads and what I assume must be an ungodly amount
of RAM, this bug would have been impossible to reproduce. I had to run
the program millions of times before I could get a single crash, and
many more times before I got a useful one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="squishing-the-bug">Squishing The Bug</h2>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/squish_bug.jpg" alt="Squish the bug">
<figcaption>
Finally, it is time to squish the bug.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>    The fix for this bug is simple. We just need to make sure that
the libraries and symbols are loaded, so that the call to
<code>malloc()</code> injected by the linker can never be executed. We
can, on the main thread before we install the signal handler, call
<code>dlopen()</code> on the library so the symbols are in the Global
Offset Table, or just call a function from the library we want to load
as a no-op.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>    Honestly, I have no conclusions. I'd never seen a bug like this
before, I've not seen any since, and I hope I never see a similar bug
ever again.</p>
<p>    I knew that something like this was possible, but it's the bug
hunting equivalent of a Lovecraftian horror rising from the depths, only
to be beaten back by a multinational coalition of sleep paralysis demons
and Mr. Ouch from those warning signs on pad-mounted transformers. It's
absurd, terrifying, and not something you expect to see in real
life.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/mr_ouch_cropped.png" alt="Mr. Ouch" /> <br> Mr Ouch
scared me as a kid. Now I just think he's pretty neat.</p>
</div>
<p>    I want to stop thinking about it, but I can't. It's too
interesting not to share. I have to write about it. Now that I'm no
longer working on Julia full time and the blog post is written,
hopefully we can put this bug to rest.</p>
