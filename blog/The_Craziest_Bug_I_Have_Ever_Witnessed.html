<h1 id="the-craziest-bug-i-have-ever-witnessed">The Craziest Bug I Have
Ever Witnessed</h1>
<p>Julia has a feature where you can report bugs and crashes from the
command line. You just run your program with
<code>julia --bug-report=rr</code>, and it sends a crash report plus an
<code>rr</code> trace of the process to our servers for us to take a
look at.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/rr-meme.jpeg" alt="rr-meme" /> <br> This is Keno's
meme, and I have unabashedly stolen it.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes we get some crazy stuff. This is in fact not the first time
that someone from the Julia team has found something crazy in a crash
dump. Keno Fischer wrote a similar (and substantially more detailed)
article <a
href="https://julialang.org/blog/2020/09/rr-memory-magic/">here</a>,
where he used <code>rr</code> to debug a process where the issue turned
out to be faulty memory.</p>
<p>Where Keno visually detailed how he found the bug, I'm just going to
rant from memory. I should have kept better records. Oh well. Live and
learn.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="the-crash">The Crash</h2>
<p>Julia is a garbage collected language, writen mostly written in
itself, but partially in C and C++. The bug manifested as a random crash
in function dispatch inside the interpreter, which is also written in
Julia. The function dispatch code is well tested. When the interpreter
crashes, it's generally the case that there was already memory
corruption.</p>
<p>We contacted the user, and we asked them for the source code of the
program that produced the crash and all the data they used to run it.
Graciously, they were able to provide it.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/println.jpg" alt="println meme" /> <br>
<code>s/println!/printf</code> is glorious.</p>
</div>
<p>Usually, my preferred method of debugging is <code>printf()</code>
debugging. It's great. It's simple. It catches most things. However, not
this time. This crash was random, and hard to reproduce. I tried to
reproduce it, but I couldn't. That doesn't mean there's no bug, it just
means it's hard. So, I am forced to take the "midwit" approach and try
to figure it out using the <code>rr</code> trace.</p>
<p>Memory corruption bugs generally suck to find. When you're writing C,
you can usually just compile with <code>-fsanitize=address</code>.
Address Sanitizer will tell you when you overwrite memory that shouldn't
be impossible to assign to within the usual confines of C or C++.
Unfortunately, the Julia runtime doesn't support being compiled with
asan because it depends on third party binaries that were <em>not</em>
compiled with asan. This means that when our binary reaches into memory
allocated for variables in those libraries, asan will throw a false
positive and crash. When one part of the process is compiled with asan,
it all must be.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="finding-the-bug">Finding The Bug</h2>
<p>Without asan as a crutch, I decided to do as my forebears did and
guess.</p>
<p>I loaded up <code>rr</code>, typed <code>bt full</code>, and... even
after a while of gawking at it, this stack trace doesn't make any sense.
The stack trace very clearly doesn't follow the control flow of the
source code. Why? How is that possible?</p>
<p>Dispatch in Julia is dynamic. From where the crash happened, my
initial guess was that either a C function pointer or Julia object was
written on top of another. But... how? And where?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/patrick_thinking.png" alt="Patrick thinking meme" />
<br>
</div>
<p>Reading through the backtrace, I found that the process crashed after
a <code>jl_call()</code> to <code>abstract_invoke()</code>. That rules
out that a C function pointer is the culprit. We're looking for a Julia
object written on top of another.</p>
<p>I was still new to the Julia codebase at this point, so for a day or
two I was stuck. I spent half an hour reading different parts of the
runtime that the process was touching. Nothing seemed to pop out at
me.</p>
<p>New idea. I try to replicate the bug through brute force. I sshed 4
different servers, downloaded the files, and ran the program 40 times at
once with <code>rr</code>, on each machine. Eventually a few of them
crashed. Some crashed in the same way. Others crashed in different ways.
The crash almost always happened in a different place. Sometimes there
was a nonsense backtrace, and sometimes there wasn't. Sometime it
crashed in Julia code, and sometimes in C code. Often it crashed in
external libraries. The bug was rare, I would get a new trace to look
through every 10 minutes or so.</p>
<p>Brute forcing it didn't give me the answer, but it did give me
information.</p>
<p>Eventually, I got an <code>rr</code> trace that seemed useful. This
led me to start reading the Julia garbage collector, and at last the
answer seemed obvious.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/I_do_see_it.jpg" alt="I do see it" /> <br> The face
I made when I had the epiphany</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>When Julia objects are allocated, they are never relocated. They stay
there forever, until they are garbage collected or the process exits.
Therefore, it is actualy impossible that an object was written on top of
another... unless it happened in the garbage collector's allocator.</p>
<p>So, I set a breakpoint on <code>jl_gc_alloc()</code>, and
<code>jl_gc_sweep()</code> and watched the pointers that came out of the
allocator. Sure enough, <code>jl_gc_alloc()</code> returned the same
pointer twice before <code>jl_gc_sweep()</code>. That is not supposed to
happen. The question remains, why is it happening?</p>
<p>When I descended deeper, I found that <code>jl_gc_alloc()</code> just
calls <code>malloc()</code>, offsets the resulting pointer, and does a
bunch of bookkeeping to register the new object with the Julia runtime.
So, it was actually <code>malloc()</code> that returned the same thing
twice.</p>
<p>... Excuse me, what? This program is single threaded!</p>
<p><br></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/biting_keyboard.jpg" alt="Biting Keyboard" /> <br>
Deliver me from this hell.</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>I time travelled back and set a breakpoint on <code>free()</code>.
Nope. It isn't freed. Libc just straight up returned the same pointer
twice. What? How does that happen?</p>
<p>Collecting myself, I noted that there was an extra call to
<code>malloc()</code> between the two calls to
<code>jl_gc_alloc()</code>. What is that?</p>
<p>When I time travelled to the next call and typed <code>bt</code> once
more into <code>rr</code>, I saw that the call to <code>malloc()</code>
happened on a signal stack inside a call to <code>dlopen()</code>.
Suddenly, I knew exactly what the bug was and where.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/bug.jpg" alt="rr-meme" /> <br> In this moment, I
felt nothing. I was numb.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Most C programmers understand that the linker can do dynamic linking
for you. Fewer understand lazy binding, and fewer have delved further
into the C or ELF standards for the other information.</p>
<p>It is unsafe to call even AS-Safe functions from a signal handler, if
the libraries they're from have not been loaded yet. If a library is
dynamically loaded inside a signal handler, it may corrupt the
allocator, which may crash the program. Or worse, like in this case, it
might not.</p>
<p>Signal safety is a difficult topic for people wrap their heads
around. <code>man signal-safety</code> is present, but doesn't do the
topic justice.</p>
<p>The short version of the signal safety rant is that if a function is
not on the list of allowed functions from
<code>man signal-safety</code>, do not call it from a signal handler.
Even if you did not type the call yourself. If you do call something
that calls something not from that list, then understand it is undefined
behavior and that you are doing so at your own peril. It is also against
the rules to modify any shared global state, or risk the same sort of
corruption.</p>
<p>This explanation is sufficient to avoid all issues with signal
handlers, but is too restrictive, and so it is ignored. We want to be
able to do interesting things in signal handlers, that's why they're
there. So, in practice, we still have to understand the rules.</p>
<p>To understand why <code>malloc()</code> is not signal safe, for
simplicity's sake suppose that it's implemented something like this:</p>

<p>In that circumstance, when the return value is decided and the thread
is paused before the bookkeeping completes, you can see how
<code>malloc()</code> would return the same thing twice. The same thing
happens inside glibc. It grabs a pointer from the freelist, but doesn't
completely erase the record of it in the same instruction. This can also
lead to the allocator getting corrupted.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-bug-so-hard-to-find">Why is this bug so hard to
find?</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/hunter_or_hunted.jpg"
alt="Not sure if I am hunting the bugs, or if the bugs are hunting me" />
<br></p>
</div>
<p>Four things make this bug particularly insidious.</p>
<p>First, the bug is not even in the code the programmer wrote. It's in
code that the linker injected, in a completely different section of the
project from where the crash happens.</p>
<p>Specifically, the crash happened inside of function dispatch inside
of LLVM ORC JIT while compiling code that the runtime had not seen
before. This was a massive red herring. LLVM had nothing to do with the
bug, it was just the first thing that requested memory after the
allocator was corrupted. Function dispatch is massively complicated,
LLVM's JIT compiler is even more complicated, and none of them were the
source of the issue.</p>
<p>Second, the code looks totally reasonable. People don't know they are
doing something unsafe by calling ostensibly signal-safe code from a
signal handler. The linker inserts a call to <code>dlopen()</code>, and
that's what calls <code>malloc()</code>. Two hidden layers. Even if you
know about one of those, you may not know about the other.</p>
<p>Third, Julia is a ridiculously large project. Working on Julia was
the first time that I touched a codebase too large for any one person to
understand, and it changes too fast to keep up with. It's enormously
challenging to maintain a mental model of the entire project, and even
more challenging to know where to look for a bug when you don't even
have a mental model. So we are forced to rely on bug reports and tools
like <code>rr</code> to help us.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/cargo_cult.jpg" /> <br> Buildkite and other CI/CD
tools are great, but not a substitute for understanding the code.</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Fourth, the bug is not reproducible. It only happens when the
backtrace signal handler is called during a call to
<code>malloc()</code>. That can happen basically anywhere. In the
original trace provided in the bug report, <code>malloc()</code> did not
crash immediately, it just returned the same pointer twice. That
allocator's bookkeeping was overwritten, but that wasn't the cause of
the crash either.</p>
<p>The crash actually happened when the Julia object that was allocated
was used. Since the same pointer was returned twice, there were two
objects that were supposed to be distinct but had the same address. By
coincidence, they were both allocated in the same place, and so they had
the same type but were supposed to hold different data, which eventually
led to the wrong function being called, a nonsense stack trace, and
eventually a crash in function dispatch.</p>
<p>I should also note that without making the use of multiple high end
servers with 40 threads and what I assume must be an ungodly amount of
RAM, this bug would have been impossible to reproduce. I had to run the
program millions of times before I could get a single crash, and many
more times before I got a useful one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="squishing-the-bug">Squishing The Bug</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/squish_bug.jpg" alt="Squish the bug" /> <br>
Finally, it is time to squish the bug.</p>
</div>
<p>The fix for this bug is simple. We just need to make sure that the
libraries and symbols are loaded, so that the call to
<code>malloc()</code> injected by the linker can never be executed. We
can, on the main thread before we install the signal handler, call
<code>dlopen()</code> on the library so the symbols are in the Global
Offset Table, or just call a function from the library we want to load
as a no-op.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Honestly, I have no conclusions. I'd never seen a bug like this
before, I've not seen any since, and I hope I never see a similar bug
ever again.</p>
<p>I knew that something like this was possible, but it's the bug
hunting equivalent of a Lovecraftian horror rising from the depths, only
to be beaten back by a coallition of sleep paralysis demons and Mr. Ouch
from those warning signs on pad-mounted transformers. It's not something
you expect to see in real life.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/mr_ouch_cropped.png" alt="Mr. Ouch" /> <br> Mr Ouch
scared me as a kid, but now I just think he's pretty neat.</p>
</div>
<p>I want to stop thinking about it, but I can't. It's too interesting
not to share. I have to write about it. Now that I'm no longer working
on Julia full time and the blog post is written, hopefully we can put
this bug to rest.</p>
