and Madness</h1>
<p>AS-Safe glibc stack traces. A descent into madness. A death by a
thousand cuts.</p>
<p>Call me melodramatic, but all I want is a nice, pretty, formatted
backtrace from a signal handler.</p>
<p>What am I to do?</p>

<p>If you compile and run this, you'll see "Recieved SIGINT" whenever it
receives one, which you can do by pressing <code>ctrl + c</code> in your
terminal. You can send it <code>SIGQUIT</code> to exit by pressing
<code>ctrl + \</code>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-signal-safety">What is signal safety?</h3>
<p>It might surprise you to learn that the example given above is not
signal-safe. Why, and what does that mean?</p>
<p>First, open your terminal, and type <code>man signal-safety</code>.
Read it. Read it all. It could, metaphorically speaking, save your life.
Or a few hours debugging.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/signal-safety1.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>And also the notes at the end.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/signal-safety2.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>While this man page does lay out a lot of crucial information, it
leaves a lot to be desired. What's actually more important than what's
written there is what isn't. It also explains what you aren't allowed to
do, but doesn't explain why. Let's explain why.</p>
<p>The man page says:</p>
<pre><code>If, at that moment, the program is interrupted by a signal handler
that also calls printf(3), then the second call to printf(3) will
operate on inconsistent data, with unpredictable results.</code></pre>
<p>Why is this? I thought that <code>printf()</code> was threadsafe?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/math.gif" width="400"></p>
</div>
<p>Well... it is. The problem is, signal handlers are not executed on a
different thread. They're actually executed on the <em>same</em> thread.
On linux, always the main thread, unless you cleverly configure signal
masks. This means that mutexes are useless at preventing race conditions
from signal handlers. In fact, they are less than useless. When used
correctly, they deadlock.</p>
<p>Note that <code>man signal-safety</code> does not contain even a
single mention of mutexes at all. It should. It should provide a stern
warning. Yet, it doesn't. I reiterate that even more important than
what's written there is what isn't.</p>
<p>Other functions are prone to these issues as well.
<code>malloc()</code>, for example, is ALSO not listed as AS-Safe in
<code>man signal-safety</code>, for the same reasons as
<code>printf()</code>. It's inherently required to operate on global
data, the bookkeeping for which could be overwritten at any time and
cannot be protected by a mutex. Losing <code>malloc()</code> rules out
most other libraries.</p>
<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/trolling.gif" /></p>
</div>
<p>Now that we understand signal safety, let's think about what we need
to do to implement backtraces that can be obtained from a signal
handler.</p>
<p>First, we need a library capable of tracing the stack. You could
write this yourself. However, it would require extensive knowledge of
the specific platform, and would not be portable. So, if you haven't
also written your own platform, you should probably use a library.</p>
<p>In practice, on ARM/x86/RISC-V/Whatever, you have a choice. You can
either use glibc (which is no doubt already installed unless you're
using an all-musl distribution) or <code>libunwind</code>. Since it's
already installed, let's use glibc. To view the docs for the glibc
backtrace library, consult the manual once again and type
<code>man backtrace</code> in your terminal.</p>
<p>The glibc functions are <code>backtrace()</code>,
<code>backtrace_symbols()</code>, <code>backtrace_symbols_fd()</code>.
The <code>backtrace_symbols()</code> function returns a
<code>malloc()</code>ed array, so it's out of the picture immediately.
The rest of the functions are not documented as AS-Safe. But, I went on
IRC, asked the glibc maintainers about it, and they said it was
safe.</p>
<h3 id="some-sort-of-shrug-meme">Some sort of shrug meme</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/signal-safety5.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>So, we need to write to a file descriptor. Sure, I thought. How bad
could it be? What ensued was agony beyond reason, horror beyond
imagination. Or something, I don't know. Melodrama aside, it was much
more difficult than I anticipated, and I think that I found a small (but
disproportionately painful) oversight in the POSIX standard.</p>
<h2 id="my-kingdom-for-a-file-descriptor">My Kingdom for a File
Descriptor</h2>
<p>We need to create a file descriptor to write into. How will we do
that?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/I_am_having_a_panic_attack.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Ideally, the bits and bytes backing the file descriptor should remain
in memory. We should call <code>memfd_create()</code>. So, we look it up
in <code>man signal-safety</code>, and... It isn't there. It's not
required by POSIX to be AS-Safe. That makes sense. It's not even from
posix, it's linux-specific, not portable, and so it wouldn't be
listed.</p>
<p>The glibc implementation of <code>memfd_create()</code> is probably
AS-Safe. Probably. I just read the source, and it's a direct syscall. I
could go ask the maintainers again to make sure. But, even being a
direct syscall isn't enough. Some syscalls are intercepted by libvdso.
And, besides, the POSIX standard doesn't know anything about syscalls.
But, it might actually be safe, depending on what guru you trust. Who is
to say.</p>
<p>Anyway. It's not technically portable. It's not on the list. So,
let's look for other options. How about using <code>mkstemp()</code>?.
It turns out, that isn't marked as AS-Safe either. Strangely enough, if
we want to create a file descriptor in a way that's fully AS-Safe, we
have to create a temp file, on disk, manually, with <code>open()</code>.
I think that's a travesty. What if the signal was sent because a disk
error?</p>
<p>It pains me, but let's just call <code>memfd_create()</code> outside
the signal handler and store it to a global variable at the start of the
program, before the signal handler is registered and before it can be
called. We already have to do some setup. We have to preemptively load
the library that glibc's <code>backtrace()</code> is implemented in, so
we may as well do a little extra.</p>
<p>Notably though, we now rely on global state. So, if the signal
handler has to run on multiple threads, or interrupts another signal
handler, it'll clobber the memfile. Luckily,
<code>pthread_sigmask()</code> exists (and newly spun threads inherit
the signal mask) to make sure signal handlers run on only one thread by
default. Also, and <code>struct sigaction::sa_mask</code> exists so that
the signal handling thread cannot be interrupted. So, these are
problems, but solvable ones.</p>
<h3 id="insert-meme-about-bane-and-pthread_sigmask.">Insert meme about
Bane and pthread_sigmask().</h3>
<h2 id="backtraces-time">Backtraces Time</h2>
<p>Okay, so now we've called <code>backtrace()</code> and
<code>backtrace_symbols_fd()</code>. Astounding. We have symbol
addresses. But they're printed into a temp file, whether it's a memfile
or a real file on disk. Now, all we have to do is parse them out. So I
wrote the parser. It's not that fancy.</p>
<h3 id="insert-no-file-names-no-bitches-meme">Insert "No file names?" No
bitches meme</h3>
<p>How do we get function names? Luckily there's a tool for this, and
it's <code>addr2line</code>, which is part of the ubiquitous GNU
<code>binutils</code> package. If you're wondering if you have it, you
probably do. We have to shell out. But it's C, and we're sticking to
posix. So, we do the classic <code>pipe()</code>, <code>dup2()</code>,
<code>fork()</code>, <code>exec()</code> song and dance. On the child
end of the pipe, we replace the execution image of the running process
with that of <code>addr2line</code>. On the parent end of the pipe, we
parse the output printed into the temp file.</p>
<p>Agonizingly though, we're still not done. The <code>addr2line</code>
tool doesn't canonicalize file paths. This can be done with
<code>realpath()</code>, but this is a signal handler, and it isn't
listed under <code>man signal-safety</code>. Excellent. So we implement
it manually once again. And by "implement it manually" what I really
mean is steal it from a nerd on StackOverflow. It's very plausible that
the glibc implementation of <code>realpath()</code> is AS-Safe, but it
takes less effort to yoink an implementation than it does to check.</p>
<h3 id="insert-meme-about-stealing-code">Insert meme about stealing
code</h3>
<p>Now that we have all of this information, we can finally print the
stack trace. But... it's not like we can call <code>printf()</code>,
even when we control the output file. Because it's still technically not
AS-Safe. Once again, the correct thing to do is to do all the formatting
manually, then call <code>write()</code> a single time on the output
file descriptor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since we must call <code>write()</code> and not
<code>printf()</code>, and <code>fflush()</code> is not AS-Safe for good
reason, there's no real way to deal with the fact that
<code>stdout</code>, <code>stderr</code>, or whatever other
<code>FILE*</code> you're writing to the file descriptor of might have
unflushed data. Even if you could actually call <code>fflush()</code>,
there would be no way to prevent another thread from buffering more data
to it before your <code>write()</code>, since mutexes are unsafe also.
This cannot be circumvented, in any way. So, there's the possibility
that the bactrace you <code>write()</code> to <code>stderr</code> gets
mixed up with other output.</p>
<p>So... that's the implementation. Agony. Here's the <a

<li><p>Did you know that lazy library loading through the linker calls
<code>malloc()</code>? Did you know this fucks everything up? See my
other article, <a href="The_Craziest_Bug_I_Have_Ever_Witnessed.html">The
Craziest Bug I have Ever Witnessed</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you know that signal handlers should not modify the value of
<code>errno</code>? We need to save the value of <code>errno</code>
before we start doing things, and restore it after. This is because
signal handlers hijack the execution of a running thread. If
<code>errno</code> is set in a hijacked thread, it may appear as though
a system call outside the signal hander has failed, or
vice-versa.</p></li>
