and Madness</h1>
<p>A descent into madness. A death by a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>Call me melodramatic, but all I want is a nice, pretty, formatted
backtrace from a signal handler.</p>
<p>What am I to do?</p>

<p>Here's an example.</p>

<p>If you compile and run this, you'll see "Recieved SIGINT" whenever it
receives one, which you can do by pressing <code>ctrl + c</code> in your
terminal. You can send it <code>SIGQUIT</code> to exit by pressing
<code>ctrl + \</code>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-signal-safety">What is signal safety?</h3>
<p>It might surprise you to learn that the example given above is not
signal-safe. Why, and what does that mean?</p>
<p>First, open your terminal, and type <code>man signal-safety</code>.
Read it. Read it all. It could, metaphorically speaking, save your life.
Or a few hours debugging.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p>And also the notes at the end.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/signal-safety2.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>While this man page does lay out a lot of crucial information, it
leaves a lot to be desired. What's actually more important than what's
written there is what isn't. It also explains what you aren't allowed to
do, but doesn't explain why. Let's explain why.</p>
<p>The man page says:</p>
<pre><code>If, at that moment, the program is interrupted by a signal handler
that also calls printf(3), then the second call to printf(3) will
operate on inconsistent data, with unpredictable results.</code></pre>
<p>Why is this? I thought that <code>printf()</code> was threadsafe?</p>
<p>Well... it is. The problem is, signal handlers are not executed on a
different thread. They're actually executed on the <em>same</em> thread.
On linux, always the main thread, unless you cleverly configure signal
masks. This means that mutexes are useless at preventing race conditions
from signal handlers. In fact, note that the man page does not contain
any mention of mutexes at all. Even attempting to acquire a mutex is
unsafe, and prone to deadlocks.</p>
<p>Other functions are prone to these issues as well.
<code>malloc()</code>, for example, is ALSO not listed as AS-Safe in
<code>man signal-safety</code>, for the same reasons as
<code>printf()</code>. It's inherently required to operate on global
data, the bookkeeping for which could be overwritten at any time. Losing
<code>malloc()</code> rules out most other libraries. It also creates
some very unintuitive results, such as <a
href="The_Craziest_Bug_I_Have_Ever_Witnessed.html">The Craziest Bug I
have Ever Witnessed</a>, which is a real world example of this where I
found a bug in the julia runtime implementation of its own backtrace
signal handler.</p>
<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/signal-safety3.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Now that we understand signal safety, let's think about what we need
to do to implement backtraces.</p>
<p>First, we need a library capable of tracing the stack. You could
write this yourself. However, it would require extensive knowledge of
the specific platform, and would not be portable. So, if you haven't
also written your own platform, you should probably use a library.</p>
<p>In practice, on ARM/x86/RISC-V/Whatever, you have a choice. You can
either use glibc (which is no doubt already installed unless you're
using an all-musl distribution) or <code>libunwind</code>. Since it's
already installed, let's use glibc. To view the docs for the glibc
backtrace library, consult the manual once again and type
<code>man backtrace</code> in your terminal.</p>
<p>The glibc functions are <code>backtrace()</code>,
<code>backtrace_symbols()</code>, <code>backtrace_symbols_fd()</code>.
<code>backtrace_symbols()</code> returns a <code>malloc()</code>ed
array, so it's out of the picture immediately. The rest of the functions
are not documented as AS-Safe. But, I went on IRC and asked the glibc
maintainers about it, and they said it was safe.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="images/signal-safety4.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>So, we need to write to a file descriptor. Sure, I thought. How bad
could it be? What ensued was agony beyond reason, horror beyond
imagination. Or something, I don't know. I think that I found a small
hole in the POSIX standard.</p>
<h3 id="a-hole-in-posix">A Hole in POSIX?</h3>
<p>We need to create a file descriptor to write into. How will we do
that?</p>
<p>Ideally, the bits and bytes backing the file descriptor should remain
in memory. So, we should call <code>memfd_create()</code>. So, we look
it up in <code>man signal-safety</code>, and... It isn't there. It's not
required by POSIX to be AS-Safe.</p>
<p>The glibc implementation of <code>memfd_create()</code> is probably
AS-Safe. Probably. I could go ask the maintainers again. But, I haven't.
There's another issue. It's linux-only. So, let's use
<code>mkstemp()</code>. But... that isn't marked as AS-Safe either.</p>
<p>-- REST OF DRAFT BEYOND THIS POINT --</p>
<h1 id="implementation-1">Implementation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Let's try to implement one
<ul>
<li>First, we need a library that does the actual tracing the stack.
<ul>
<li>You could write this yourself. However, it would require extensive
knowledge of the specific platform, and would not be portable. So, if
you haven't also written your own platform, you should use a library.
<ul>
<li>libunwind impl</li>
<li>glibc impl</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>glibc provides <code>backtrace()</code>,
<code>backtrace_symbols()</code>, and
<code>backtrace_symbols_fd()</code>.
<ul>
<li><code>backtrace_symbols()</code> returns a <code>malloc()</code>ed
array, so it's out of the picture.</li>
<li>So, we need to write to a file descriptor. Sure, I thought. How bad
could it be?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We need a temp file descriptor to write into.
<ul>
<li><code>memfd_create()</code>? Nope. Not signal-safe.</li>
<li><code>mkstemp()</code>? Nope. Not signal-safe either.</li>
<li>So actually, what we need to do is create the file descriptor to
print the trace into, before the handler is even called.
<ul>
<li>We will be calling <code>memfd_create()</code> after all.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now we have symbol addresses. We want function names.
<ul>
<li>There's a tool for this, and it's called
<code>addr2line</code>.</li>
<li>It's specified in POSIX. We have to shell out.</li>
<li>This is the classic, <code>pipe()</code>, <code>dup2()</code>,
<code>fork()</code>, <code>exec()</code> song and dance.
<ul>
<li>On the child end of the pipe, we replace the execution image with
<code>addr2line</code>.</li>
<li>On the parent end of the pipe, we parse the output of
<code>addr2line</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We now can build and print the stack trace.
<ul>
<li>Ah, but wait. Not so easy. <code>addr2line</code> gives us
unresolved file paths with a bunch of dots in them. We should probably
resolve them first.
<ul>
<li>It turns out that this has to be done manually, can't call
realpath().
<ul>
<li>Maybe this is actually AS-Safe in glibc, but I haven't checked, I
just did it myself.</li>
<li>Which is to say that I stole it off some nerd on StackOverflow.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can't exactly call <code>printf()</code> and write to stdout.
<code>printf()</code> is unsafe.
<ul>
<li>You could create a memfd and <code>fdopen()</code> it, then
<code>fprintf()</code> to that. Why not?
<ul>
<li>It turns out that <code>fprintf()</code> isn't standardized to be
AS-Safe when it has exclusive access to the backing <code>FILE*</code>
structure, so this is nonstandard and may just break on some machines.
It probably does break at least on some.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The correct thing to do is to do all the formatting yourself,
manually. Then make one singlular <code>write()</code> to the file
descriptor you wish to write to.
<ul>
<li>If you make multiple <code>write()</code>s, they might get
interleaved with writes on other threads.</li>
<li>It is not possible to do this write to any arbitrary
<code>FILE*</code> structure, because <code>fileno()</code> is
apparently unsafe as well, unsure as to why. It would be nice to be able
to write to any <code>FILE*</code>, but sadly that is not possible.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There's no real way to deal with the fact that stdout, stderr, etc
may have unflushed data. Even if you could call <code>fflush()</code>
(you can't, it's unsafe), it would be impossible to garuntee that
another thread won't just immediately buffer more. This cannot be
circumvented, because mutexes are not signal safe. So there's the
possibility that the backtrace you <code>write()</code> gets mixed in
with other stuff. But that's probably acceptable, which is good because
we need to accept it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="bonus-gotchas">Bonus Gotchas</h1>
<ul>
<li>Bonus Gotchas
<ul>
<li>Lazy library loading through the linker calls <code>malloc()</code>
and is unsafe.
<ul>
<li>Must be preloaded, either by <code>dlopen()</code>ing it or by
inserting a dummy call to make sure the <code>malloc()</code> isn't
incurred inside the signal handler.</li>
<li>By sheer coincidence, this was the cause of the bug that I found in
another of my articles, <a
href="The_Craziest_Bug_I_Have_Ever_Witnessed.html">The Craziest Bug I
have Ever Witnessed</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The starting value of <code>errno</code> should be saved at the
beginning, and restored at the end. Other threads are not a concern
here, but it could otherwise overwite the error value for the current
thread at any time, which would be very unfortunate. It would seem as
though a syscall failed when it hadn't, or vice-versa.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Takeaways, and the implementation:
<ul>
<li>Okay, that was a lot. So, here you go. Here's the code.
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/apaz-cli/daisho/blob/master/stdlib/Native/PreStart/Backtrace.h">code</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do not do any work in signal handlers, unless you really really know
what you are doing. Ideally, set a flag and gtfo.</li>
<li>You can also choose to do it like I do, but honestly don't. It's
absolute purgatory.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that you find this useful. May you never feel my pain.</p>
