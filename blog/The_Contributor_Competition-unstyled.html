competition. How can you win?</h4>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>    How difficult it is to contribute to any particular open source
project matters. It matters a lot. I'm talking primarily about mature
open source projects, but parts of this rant are still applicable for
new and closed source projects as well. Most of it is just generally
good advice for running any sort of team.</p>
<p>    Contributors are usually there to solve their own problems and
optimize their own experience. They care about their own use case.
Generally speaking, contributors don't care about the maintainer's
problems as much as the maintainer may hope. Especially if they cannot
at a glance understand those problems.</p>
<p>    Potential contributors may support your mission, but it's hard to
make them sacrifice for it. Contributors want to contribute so that they
can avoid pain, not take on more pain. They have a very short attention
span. If they can't immediately solve their problem, they will leave.
They'll find a workaround without upstreaming a fix, or just find some
other project.</p>

</div>
<p>    Unless you can find a select few rare and ideologically motivated
individuals, the only way to find contributors who will sacrifice for
your cause is to pay them. Nobody wants to clean up your mess for you.
Open sourcing your code is not going to change that. Nobody is going to
materialize next to you with a solution.</p>
<p>    I've had multiple conversations with maintainers to the effect of
"We have a long list of good first issues, why is nobody picking them
up? We have like three hundred of them! Fix our type inference bugs!
Debug our segfaults! Why are there no new contributors? They should be
cleaning up after us!"</p>
<p>    Ideologues forget that non-ideologues have their own problems to
deal with. Never make this mistake, it can kill your project. I've seen
it happen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<hr>
<p>    Understanding how to operate in such a world where contributors
are selfish, pain-averse, and low attention span requires a paradigm
shift. For an open source contributor, the decision to contribute or not
is a simple risk vs reward. The risk is wasted time. The reward is
getting features and fixes merged.</p>
<p>    I think about open source in much the same way as I think about a
startup trying to find product-market fit. The more annoying the
experience, the more users and contributors will churn. But get it
right, and you could experience explosive growth. Not only is it
important to have a product that feels great to use, it's important to
have a product that feels fun to work on.</p>

</div>
<p>    So put your thumb on the scale. Change the risk/reward
calculation. Make something useful, that's a delight to work on. Both
are equally important.</p>
<p>    The eventual hope is that maybe some of short term contributors
will keep using your project and turn into long term contributors and
maintainers. People that you can design new features with, who can
review your code and point out conceptual issues. Eventually. This comes
with building friendships in the community. But to make friends you've
got to put yourself out there.</p>
<p>    So in addition to lowering the barrier to entry, You need to make
sure people know it's low. Otherwise they may make a subconscious error
in their risk/reward analysis and not contribute, to the detriment of
all parties.</p>

<h2 id="actionable-advice.">Actionable Advice.</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is all well and good. But it's not actionable advice. Here is
some actionable advice.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Automated testing is a must. Write well thought out and
exhaustive tests that don't flake, so that contributors can be confident
that their features and fixes won't cause regressions elsewhere.
Prioritize integration tests. Equally important, write up a guide on how
to add tests and run them, and place it somewhere prominent. Both
processes should be as frictionless as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Document anything that would not be immediately understandable by
a layperson. As a Julia/LLVM example, nobody without a degree in
compiler engineering is going to understand what a phi node is. It's
core knowledge for understanding how Julia works, but that doesn't
matter. You can't expect people to have this knowledge when they start
reading your code. If you want contributors, then this is unacceptable.
It needs to be documented and made simple.</p></li>
<li><p>APIs should be self documenting, but you should document them
anyway. Exhaustively. You can do this with LLMs, they're very good at
it. If it's Python or another language with optional typing, add type
annotations. Not as a tool for communicating with a type checker, but as
a tool for communicating with humans. When they're absent, people spend
time figuring out all the different places a function could be called
from. Don't annoy your contributors. Add type annotations.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a Discord server. Or a public slack, an IRC, a Discourse,
or Github discussions, or whatever. Wherever your potential users are.
It's usually Discord, but might be somewhere else. Then be active there
answering questions. Think of this time as an investment. If people see
discussions about features and PRs, they know that if they write a PR
and encounter issues they can ask questions there as well. Then they may
go do that. It's also a good way to disseminate knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge and appreciate contributions. Doesn't matter how
large or small. You want contributing to your project to feel good. Make
sure they feel proud of their work. This too is an investment. Build
friendships that turn short term contributors into long term
contributors.</p></li>
<li><p>Create tutorials and examples. If your project has a feature it
needs a tutorial or example. Otherwise nobody will know about it. These
can also serve as very effective marketing material.</p></li>
<li><p>Office hours can be incredibly useful. Voice and/or video
communication is much higher bandwidth than text alone, making it the
superior medium for feature design discussions. But why office hours
specifically? It's possible to ask the relevant parties if they want to
VC, but demanding that much time can be seen as daunting or rude. It's
often better just to set a regular meeting time for discussions of any
sort.</p></li>
<li><p>Imagine yourself in the shoes of a new user and contributor.
You're using the project for X, and you want to implement new feature Y.
Where is it likely you would get stuck, if you were to use and read your
code for the first time? Are all the places that would need to be
changed intuitive and easy to find? How can you fix or document this? If
you have willing contributors, use them as test subjects and solicit
feedback on the experience. Not just the experience of using the
project, also the experience of modifying it.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain the bar for code quality, without slowing contributors
down. The main question you should be asking as a reviewer is "is this
maintainable?" This question comes even before the question "is this
correct." If unmaintainable code gets merged, it will complicate things
down the road. But don't let reviews drag on, or it will add friction to
contributing. If the PR is sensible, maintainable, and correct, it's
often better just to merge and submit a cleanup PR yourself than to
nitpick.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="tldr">TLDR</h3>
<p>    Empower your contributors. Do this by identifying potential
roadblocks to drive-by contributions, and ripping them out. Give them as
much agency as possible.</p>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<p><br></p>
<p>    This beneficial for a few reasons. One of them is purely
psychological. I feel like the progress I make as a contributor is
dependent on my mental state. If contributing to a project is draining I
can't work nearly as many hours, and my code quality drops noticeably.
Sometimes it can get so miserable that I want to quit and become a goose
farmer. Better than dealing with layers of technical debt and political
nonsense. Maybe you've felt the same. People are not productive when
they're miserable.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>    Additionally, in the path from "demo" to "product" there are a
lot of tiny annoyances that will irk users. They're hard to identify,
and enough of them can sink a project. It's why QA testing exists as a
concept. If drive-by contributions are difficult, these problems will
persist. A tremendous amount of the value of a product is locked up in
fixing these tiny annoyances.</p>
<p>    The benefit of open source is primarily in crowdsourcing the QA
process. Ideologues can grin and bear it, but neglect drive-by
contributors at your peril. Your project will have lots of features, but
it might still suck, suffering a death by a thousand cuts and never
finding product-market fit.</p>
<p>    I hope that you found this rant useful.</p>
