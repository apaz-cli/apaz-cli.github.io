<h2 id="a-case-study.">A case study.</h2>
<hr>
<p>    Python and Julia are programming languages that fill a very
similar niche. They're both dynamic scripting languages popular in the
scientific computing space. Why is Julia languishing, while Python is
flourishing?</p>
<p>    No language is "better" than another. Usually these comparisons
are an exercise in tribalism. But bear with me here. Let's look at just
the technology. In a vacuum, Julia seems overwhelmingly "better" than
Python. It's a complex and incredible marvel of engineering. It has
everything going for it, from a technical perspective. Why, then, does
Julia not attract any new contributors? Surely all of that should make
people want to work on it, right?</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<hr>
<p>    Yeah, no. None of that matters. We don't live in a vaccum. You
can have the fanciest compiler in the world. Nobody cares.</p>
<p>    Developer experience matters. More than enough to sink an entire
project.</p>
<p>    Fundamentally, what contributors want is to solve their own
problems and optimize their own experience. They are selfish. They think
about how to use the project to accomplish their own goals. They don't
care about the maintainer's problems as much as the maintainer may hope.
Especially if they cannot at a glance understand those problems.</p>
<p>    Potential contributors may support your mission, but it's hard to
make them sacrifice for it.</p>
<p>    Contributors want to contribute so that they can avoid pain, not
take on more pain. They have a very short attention span. If they can't
immediately solve their problem, they will leave. They'll find a
workaround without upstreaming a fix, or just find some other project.
Unless you can find a select few rare and ideologically motivated
individuals, the only way to get contributors who will sacrifice for
your cause is to pay them. Nobody wants to clean up your mess for you.
Open sourcing your code is not going to change that. Nobody is going to
materialize next to you with a solution.</p>
<p>    I've had multiple conversations with maintainers to the effect of
"We have a long list of good first issues, why is nobody picking them
up? We have like three hundred of them! Fix our type inference bugs!
Debug our segfaults! Why are there no new contributors? They should be
cleaning up after us!"</p>
<p>    They forget that non-ideologues have their own problems to deal
with.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<hr>
<p>    This requires a paradigm shift. For an open source contributor,
the decision to contribute or not is a simple risk vs reward. The risk
is wasted time. The reward is getting features and fixes merged. In this
way, it's a lot like a startup product. The more annoying the
experience, the more users and contributors will churn. But get it
right, and you could experience explosive growth.</p>
<p>    To maximize external contributions, maintainers need to
drastically lower the barrier to entry while making the project as
useful as possible. That way people are drawn to the project, and useful
contributions to your project will not require much sacrifice. It
changes the risk/reward calculation. The hope is that maybe some of
those short term contributors will keep using your project and turn into
long term contributors and maintainers. People that you can design new
features with, who can review your code and point out conceptual
issues.</p>
<p>    In addition to lowering the barrier to entry, You need to make
sure people know it's low. Otherwise they may make a subconscious error
in their risk/reward analysis and not contribute, to the detriment of
all parties. Advertising good developer experience is helpful in
advertising the project, but even more helpful for the maintinence of
the project.</p>

<h2 id="actionable-advice.">Actionable Advice.</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is all well and good. But it's not actionable advice. Here is
some actionable advice.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Automated testing is a must. Write good, exhaustive tests that
don't flake so that contributors can be confident that their features
and fixes won't cause regressions elsewhere. Prioritize integration
tests. Equally important, write up a guide on how to add tests and run
them, and place it somewhere prominent. Both processes should be as
frictionless as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Document anything that would not be immediately understandable by
a layperson. As a Julia/LLVM example, nobody without a degree in
compiler engineering is going to understand what a phi node is. It's
core knowledge for understanding how Julia works, but that doesn't
matter. You can't expect people to have this knowledge when they start
reading your code. If you want contributors, then this is unacceptable.
It needs to be documented and made simple.</p></li>
<li><p>APIs should be self documenting, but you should document them
anyway. Exhaustively. You can do this with LLMs, they're very good at
it. If it's python or another language with optional typing, add type
annotations. Not as a tool for communicating with a type checker, but as
a tool for communicating with humans. When they're absent, people spend
time figuring out all the different places a function could be called
from. Don't annoy your contributors. Add type annotations.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a Discord server. Or a public slack, an IRC, a Discourse,
or Github discussions, or whatever. Wherever your potential users are.
It's usually Discord, but might be somewhere else. Then be active there
answering questions. Think of this time as an investment. If people see
discussions about features and PR, they know that if they write a PR and
encounter issues they can ask questions there as well. Then they may go
do that. It's also a good way to disseminate knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge and appreciate contributions. Doesn't matter how
large or small. You want contributing to your project to feel good. Make
sure they feel proud of their work. This too is an investment. The goal
is to turn short term contributors into long term contributors.</p></li>
<li><p>Create tutorials and examples. If your project has a feature it
needs a tutorial or example. Otherwise nobody will know about it. These
can also serve as very effective marketing material.</p></li>
<li><p>Office hours can be incredibly useful. Voice and/or video
communication is much higher bandwidth than text alone, making it the
superior medium for feature design discussions. But why office hours
specifically? It's possible to ask the relevant parties if they want to
VC, but demanding that much time can be seen as daunting or rude. It's
often better just to set a regular meeting time for discussions of any
sort.</p></li>
<li><p>Imagine yourself in the shoes of a new user and contributor.
You're using the project for X, and you want to implement new feature Y.
Where is it likely you would get stuck, if you were to use and read your
code for the first time? Are all the places that would need to be
changed intuitive and easy to find? How can you fix or document this? If
you have willing contributors, use them as test subjects and solicit
feedback on the experience. Not just the experience of using the
project, also the experience of modifying it.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain a high bar for quality.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>TLDR, empower your contributors.</p>
<p>Identify potential roadblocks and rip them out before they become a
problem. things that might be holding them back. Remove roadblocks.</p>
