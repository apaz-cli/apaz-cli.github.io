<h1 id="errors-and-configuration">Errors and Configuration</h1>
<p>If there's one thing that programmers hate, it's edge cases. They're
annoying and time consuming.</p>
<p><img src="images/Snake_moriya_suwako.jpg" /></p>
<p>The more sources for error you have, the more edge cases you're
likely to have. Unfortunately, often the growth is not linear. You have
to think about these edge cases, and write extra code to handle
them.</p>
<p>This sort of thing comes up a lot. An example would be opening a file
in C. You have to:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Open the file for reading</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Get the size of the file on disk</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Allocate a buffer large enough to store the file&#39;s contents</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Read from the file into the buffer</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Null terminate the buffer</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Close the file</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Basically all of these operations can go wrong. The buffer and the
file pointer are resources that need to be cleaned up on failure. This
complicates error handling. Opening a file isn't hard (although the
language makes it much harder than it should be), but it's easy to
accidentally leak the buffer or forget to close the file on one of the
many errors if you're not careful. There's no other way to get it right
than to squint at your monitor and trace through all the edge cases.</p>
<p>Now suppose your code is firmware supposed to handle something truly
unlikely. For example, the internal flash inside your microcontroller
fails mid-write. Or, the wires attaching some sensors to your airplane's
engine controller get struck by a bolt of lightning, causing the
readings to spike to physically impossible levels and then go dead as
the wires melt. These situations aren't very testable. How can we be
confident that they're handled correctly so the plane doesn't crash?</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="the-solution-to-the-problem">The Solution to the Problem</h2>
<p>What we need is some way to make sure the number edge cases stays
manageable. Here are a few ways.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Reduce the number of sources of error in project planning.</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss"> * </span>Limit the scope of the project.</span>

<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>

There&#39;s &quot;out of memory&quot;, and there&#39;s &quot;couldn&#39;t open the file.&quot;</span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>   The average programmer doesn&#39;t have to care if that&#39;s due to a failed integrity check or a sledgehammer. There&#39;s an argument that splitting out</span>

<h3 id="a-bigger-problem-needs-a-bigger-solution">A Bigger Problem Needs
a Bigger Solution</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not enough for me. A programming language
runtime is truly massive. Trying to reverse engineer and configure
what's available on each machine with its own exotic (or even mundane)
archetecture and version of the C ecosystem is linearly more painful on
the best of days, and exponentially on the worst. All known approaches
have failed me. I've come up with my own instead.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="a-layered-taxonomy-of-errors">A Layered Taxonomy of Errors</h2>
<p>I found that what I really needed is to categorize. An error can
happen during:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode md"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Environment detection</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Compiler configuration</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Package configuration</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Compile time</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">* </span>Run time</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Each of these layers flows information down to the next layer.</p>
<p>An error is either recoverable or not recoverable. It may not even be
an error necessarily. For example, not finding a <code>python</code>
binary on the host system isn't necessarily a problem. It just means
that the feature of being able to write inline python from daisho code
is unavailable. It turns daisho code that is perfectly reasonable on one
machine into a compile time (or package configuration) error on another.
It's only a problem if having a python interpreter is something that
ends up being depended on, but we still need to flow the information
down.</p>
