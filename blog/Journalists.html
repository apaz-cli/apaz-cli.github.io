<h1 id="journalists">Journalists</h1>
<p>For the longest time I've felt like the mainstream media was biased
and out of touch. If you asked most people, they would probably agree
with that. But a few months ago I had a few interactions with mainstream
journalists at tech meetups. Specifically, I was interviewed by Forbes.
And by a few other outlets since then.</p>
<p>I have three gripes. They</p>
<h2 id="gripe-1-zombie-journalists">Gripe #1: Zombie Journalists</h2>
<p>I'll describe the first time I met a journalist, at a company happy
hour.</p>
<p>The interaction felt empty in a way that I found difficult to put my
finger on. They asked me for details on the projects I was working on,
how they were important, and why. At first, I felt seen in an incredible
way. Journalists have a way of making you feel like that.</p>
<p>But I also felt in the back of my mind that although the journalist I
was speaking to was very professional, and she was very good at asking
questions, she truly was not interested in the technology that she was
writing about. It's fine not to understand, most people do not know or
care about deep learning compilers, but I felt that she did not care to
understand either. She did not ask clarifying questions, even I prompted
her to.</p>
<p>She just wrote down what I said, and tried to make me feel special.
It was a bit unsettling. Every journalist I've spoken to since then has
made me feel this way.</p>
<p>When the article came out the next morning, I was astonished to find
that her name was not even on the article. Instead, it was some random
dude that I never met. Even though she did all the information gathering
for it. She did all the research! She should get credit! What the
heck!</p>
<p>Every time I've spoken with a journalist since, I've felt the same
professional emptiness and disinterest. I guess now I know why she felt
that way. Knowing you're not going to get any credit for your reporting
has got to suck major ass.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2024/03/28/lightning-studio-an-ios-for-ai-development/">here's
the article</a> this story is based on.</p>
<h2 id="gripe-2-zombie-reporting">Gripe #2: Zombie Reporting</h2>
<p>I feel like, even as they report on current events, major media
outlets are hopelessly trapped in the past.</p>
<p>Mainstream media is beholden to the whim of capital. Pay them, and
they'll write a story on you. Everybody knows that. That's old news.
Give me something more interesting.</p>
<p>I wish I never thought that. Because just as I thought that, <a
href="https://time.com/collection/time100-ai-2024/">this
dropped</a>.</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;This makes me want to scream and vomit
simultaneously.&lt;&gt;</p>
<p>Time released their list of 100</p>
<p>Where is Tri Dao? Where is Woosuk Kwon? Where is Zhuohan Li? Was
whoever made this list on fucking crack?</p>
<p>Reviled</p>
<p>What bothers me more is that irks me more than that is that</p>
<p>know that. It used to be that</p>

If it isn't capital intensive it doesn't exist.</h2>
