        <p>RootwallaBot is a Discord bot that does hypergeometric probability/distribution, and graphs the results.
            It&#39;s particularly useful to people who play a lot of trading card games such as Magic: the Gathering
            or Yugioh. </p>
        <p>While building a deck, you may think to yourself: If my 60 card deck contains 24 lands, what are the
            chances that I draw between 2 to 4 of them in my opening hand of 7 cards? You can see the graph of
            expected frequency above, along with mean and standard deviation. The command pictured above graphs
            relative frequency, but the /prob command will tell you that the probability is roughly 77.46%.</p>

        <p>MonikaBot is another Discord bot. This one just posts quotes and images of the character Monika from the
            game Doki Doki Literature Club. It also has some administrative features built into it.</p>
        <p>I&#39;m running both the Monika and Rootwalla bots from a Raspberry Pi in my dorm room. MonikaBot was
            created for a college club and gets some use from time to time. RootwallaBot was created for a Magic the
            Gathering Discord server and serves ~200 daily users.</p>

    </ul>
    <p> A hash function is one that takes some sort of input data and maps it onto a certain configuration on a fixed
        size set of bits. The hope is that you can use the bits generated, the hash, to re-identify the thing that the
        hash describes. If two peices of data have the same hash, there&#39;s a high chance that they&#39;re duplicates.
    </p>
    <p> Hash functions have for a long time been relevant in cryptography and networking. If the hash of a message is
        attached to the end of the message, the recipient can simply re-hash the message to verify its integrity. If
        there&#39;s even one bot flipped, then the recipient will know. But, what if you want a hash function that&#39;s
        resilient to small changes in the input?</p>
    <p> Very often, small transmission errors should be overlooked because an image was transfered using a network
        protocol that doesn&#39;t validate messages. Other times, you have a .png image and a .jpg image that are
        clearly visually identical, but a cryptographic hash function would call them completely different images
        because of one or two almost imperceptible jpg compression artifacts. A perceptual hash function generates a
        hash based on &quot;what the image looks like&quot; rather than a cryptographic mangling of bits. The images
        above describe the process for the simplest such algorithm, aHash.</p>
    <p> This is actually a rather difficult and interesting problem, which has led me to many places, from image and
        signal processing to computational geometry and deep learning. All because I wanted to remove duplicate images
        from a folder. I ended up eventually doing that, but I also built a framework so that anyone can create their
        own system to efficiently hash, store, and compare hashes, and to build and benchmark image hashing algorithms.
        It was a bit overkill, but a whole lot of fun. </p>
    <p> It took a long time because I built the entire system from scratch. I couldn&#39;t find an image library that
        could do pixel comparisons fast enough, so I built my own. I couldn&#39;t find an implementation of a VP-Tree
        (computational geometry data structure for fast nearest-neighbor lookup) that I liked, so I built my own. I read
        all the original papers and implemented the algorithms from scratch. It&#39;s my passion project, and I&#39;ve
        put a lot of time into it.</p>

            alt="Loss function mathematically described"></p>
    <p> After a while, I began to think that conventional image hashing algorithms are great, but there&#39;s got to be
        a better way. I spent a long time thinking deeply about what was important to what an image &quot;looked
        like&quot; and the ways each algorithm did and didn&#39;t distill the &quot;essence,&quot; whatever that means,
        of an image. Eventually I realized that this would be a perfect application of machine learning. Simply
        construct the system in such a way that I don&#39;t have to decide what is and isn&#39;t important to the
        algorithm. Just let the computer do it.</p>
    <p> Another great benefit is that if you want the resulting hash function to be invariant to something, such as
        noise, rotation, scaling, etc, all you have to do is design a loss function that sets the distance between the
        resulting hashes to zero. So that&#39;s what I did. The architecture that I settled on was a convolutional
        autoencoder with a variation on triplet margin loss.</p>
    <p> This is still somewhat of a work in progress, because I&#39;m still messing around with loss functions and
        trying to design one that&#39;s even better. However, it works, and I&#39;m soon going to hook my machine
        learning image hash function into my image hashing framework. It&#39;ll be free for any developer to use.</p>

    <p> Brainfuck is an intentionally confusing programming language, named for the experience of writing and debugging
        its code. It was not created to be useful, but to challenge, amuse, and punish programmers. Despite the absurd
        complexity of BF programs, the language itself is quite simple.</p>
    <p> For a long time, I&#39;ve been interested in compiler theory, and creating my own programming language. After
        all, most features of higher level languages than C are just C design patterns in disguise. What is an object
        but a struct with associated functions? That&#39;s a C design pattern. People write object-oriented C code all
        the time. What is a template but a sequence of macros? What is an interface but a generalized template? What is
        a lambda expression but a struct holding a function pointer (or not because it can be devirtualized by the
        compiler) that is also an object implementing a functional interface?</p>
    <p> Unfortunately, building a compiler is very difficult. Fortunately however, Brainfuck is a very simple language,
        and writing an interpreter for it is relatively easy. So I did. Then I also wrote a compiler for it that
        transpiles Brainfuck to C code, then calls a C compiler to produce a binary. Every programming language is in a
        sense just C in disguise, and BF is no exception.</p>
