 RootwallaBot is a Discord bot that does hypergeometric probability/distribution, and graphs the results. It's particularly useful to people who play a lot of trading card games such as Magic: the Gathering or Yugioh. 
 
 While building a deck, you may think to yourself: If my 60 card deck contains 24 lands, what are the chances that I draw between 2 to 4 of them in my opening hand of 7 cards? You can see the graph of expected frequency above, along with mean and standard deviation. The next image is the command for checking the probability of the same scenario, but this time with 25 lands.
